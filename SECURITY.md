# Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Email: onco.coiffure@orange.fr
- Please include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact.
- We aim to acknowledge reports within 5 business days.

## Scope
- Public repository content, GitHub Actions workflows, and front-end code in `src/`.
- Third‑party services (CDNs, fonts, maps) are out of scope but we welcome heads‑up if misconfigurations are found.

## Do Not
- Do not perform tests that could degrade service for others (no DDoS, spam, or automated scanning at high rates).
- Do not access or modify data that isn’t yours.

## Dependencies
- Automated updates via Dependabot help keep Actions and NPM dependencies current.
- Code scanning via GitHub CodeQL runs on pushes and pull requests.

Thank you for helping keep users safe!
